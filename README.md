# TP-ASP.NET-GL3
This is a project that was made in the first 4 lab sessions in the dotNET module in my courses as a Software Engineering Student @INSAT

For the Design, I used Bootswatch **Sketchy** Theme
"https://bootswatch.com/sketchy/"

* The uploaded image was done in the testing process, use it as You like
* There are some seeding in genres and membership types
* check that you have SQL Server to use your database and you installed the needed packages

To update the database you need to delete the files in the **migrations** folder and then in the _"Package Manager Console"_:

(( Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console ))

```add-migration [migrationName]```

```update-database```
